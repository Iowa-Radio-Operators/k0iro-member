    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the K0IRO Membership Management Center</h1>

    <p>
        We’re excited that you’re considering joining a statewide community built for radio enthusiasts of all backgrounds. 
        K0IRO exists to provide a welcoming space for operators to connect, especially in areas where a local club isn’t 
        available or where gathering opportunities are limited. Our goal is simple: create a supportive, accessible, and 
        engaging environment for amateur radio operators across Iowa.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before applying, we encourage you to explore a few key pages that explain who we are and what we stand for:
    </p>

    <ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 0.5rem;">
        <li><a href="https://k0iro.com/about/" target="_blank">About Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://k0iro.com/about/mission-vision/" target="_blank">Mission &amp; Vision</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://k0iro.com/about/bylaws/" target="_blank">Club Charter &amp; Bylaws</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These documents outline our purpose, values, and the framework that guides our club.
    </p>

    <p>
        You’ll also find information about membership dues. At this time, we are not yet set up to accept dues payments — 
        and that’s perfectly fine. As a new organization, our officers are finalizing the administrative details behind 
        the scenes. When everything is ready, we’ll reach out to early members to complete the dues process.
    </p>

    <p>
        If everything sounds good, simply click <strong>Apply</strong> in the upper‑right corner, fill out the form, and 
        you’ll be on your way. We’re glad you’re here and look forward to welcoming you into the K0IRO community.
